            Indian skipper Rohit Sharma had missed the opening Test match of the two-game series against Bangladesh in Chattogram owing to a thumb injury he had incurred during the ODI series that preceded it. Reports now claim that Rohit is likely to return to Bangladesh for the second Test, to be played in Mirpur starting December 22. But his return is likely to create a massive selection headache especially after stunning centuries from Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara. When asked who would sit out if Rohit returned, former India cricketer Ajay Jadeja gave a stunning reply.</p>
